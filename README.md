# ToC-Char_sheet
Based on a sheet originally coded by: Heilemann - committed on Oct 29, 2014 <br><br>
This is my own version of a Trail of Cthulhu character sheet for Roll20.<br>
It uses my own 'My Way’-rule’s layout. This is mostly how some abilities are placed and referred to, ex. Sanity, Stability, and Health are removed from the ability section and only exist in one place on the side, this is for clarity and the fact they are not really 'abilities' but basic attributes. Cthulhu Mythos gets its own spot for the same reason, Credit Rating is moved to connect to Occupations, etc.<br>
There is no roll or any other automated functions, all is done by 'hand' so to say.<br>
Anyone interested in adding functionality is welcome to do so, if so I would appreciate if you could give me a ping about it. :)<br><br>
Sorry for my poor English, and code...
