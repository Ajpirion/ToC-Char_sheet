# ToC-Char_sheet
My first R20 character sheet <br>
This is my own version of a Trail of Cthulhu character sheet for Roll20.<br>
It uses my own 'My Way'-rules layout. This is mostly about how some abilities are placed and refered to, ex. Sanity, Stability and Health is removed from the ability section and only excist in one place on the side, this for clarity and the fact they are not realy 'abilities' but basic attributes. Cthulhu Mythos gets its own spot for the same reason, Credit Rating is moved to conect to Occupations etc.
