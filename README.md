# ToC-Char_sheet
Based on a sheet originaly coded by: Heilemann - committed on Oct 29, 2014 <br><br>
This is my own version of a Trail of Cthulhu character sheet for Roll20.<br>
It uses my own 'My Way'-rules layout. This is mostly about how some abilities are placed and refered to, ex. Sanity, Stability and Health is removed from the ability section and only excist in one place on the side, this for clarity and the fact they are not realy 'abilities' but basic attributes. Cthulhu Mythos gets its own spot for the same reason, Credit Rating is moved to conect to Occupations etc.<br>
There is no roll or any other automated funktions, all is done by 'hand' so to say.<br>
Anyone intrested in adding functionality are welcome to do so, if so I would appriciate if you could give me a ping about it. :)<br><br>
Sorry for my poor english, and code...
